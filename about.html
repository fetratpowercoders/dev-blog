                <p class="italic "> My name is Sakina sadaf.I am living in Switzerland since February 2018. I am an Afghan from Parwan province which is located in north of Kabul. I lived in Kabul the capital city of Afghanistan. I studied political science and public administration at American university of Afghanistan and worked for Swiss Cooperation office of Afghanistan in administration and communication position for some years. I am well experience in coordination, organization, administration and women rights features. I never had the opportunity to explore the IT field in my country even though I was very much curios about it. some months ago, by accident I saw an opportunity of learning coding with POWERCODERS school so I decide to discover this field by participating in thier 3 months training. This devblog is a project of my practice during these 3mornhs of learning.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by,</p>
